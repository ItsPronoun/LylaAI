    This file is a part of LylaAI, a custom homunculus/mercenary AI for Ragnarok Online.

    All homunculus/mercenary AI begins with a file named AI.lua/AI_M.lua. This file is
    loaded by the Ragnarok Online client at runtime, and several times per second the
    function named `AI(id)` is called to perform AI functionality.
    
    This AI is free to distribute and to make changes. However, I encourage you to
    submit bugs and feature requests to the official GitHub repository so we can make this 
    a better AI together.
