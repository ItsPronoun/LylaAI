# LylaAI

A custom homunculus/mercenary AI for Ragnarok Online.

At the moment it is in early development and there are no promises that it works for you or your server. It is currently being developed on uaRO, but the plan is for it to work on all/most servers that support custom AI.

At the moment, I recommend you use AzzyAI as it is mature and has more features/less bugs. The hope is that, eventually, this will be a well-featured and modern alternative with more customizability.

You can find AzzyAI [here](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/AzzyAI).\
**Note: I do not own nor do I provide support for AzzyAI.**
